## POS Tagger Models

The POS tagger models files (.tagger files and their corresponding .props files) should be put in this directory which can be downloaded [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml).

### Note

At the moment, the POS tagger models are read by the src/main/java/pos/PosTaggerModel class. The file names need to be properly configured in this class in order for the evaluator to find the models.
